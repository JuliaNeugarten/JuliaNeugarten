Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Julia Neugarten. I am a junior researcher at the [Huygens Institute](https://www.huygens.knaw.nl/en/) in the department of [Computational Literary Studies](https://www.huygens.knaw.nl/en/projecten/?thema=computationele-literatuurwetenschap) working on the projects [CLARIAH](https://www.clariah.nl/) and [Impact & Fiction](https://impactandfiction.huygens.knaw.nl/).

In my free time, I enjoy creative writing, cooking and baking, boardgames and spinning.
