Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Julia Neugarten. I am currently completing my PhD at the [Radboud University, Nijmegen](https://www.ru.nl/) in the project [Anchoring Innovation](https://anchoringinnovation.nl/).  The project has the preliminary title _Gods, Heroes, Myths: Anchoring and Innovating Classical Motifs in Fanfiction._

In my free time, I enjoy creative writing, cooking and baking, boardgames and spinning.
