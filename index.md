## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profielfoto1.jpg">

Hi!

My name is Julia Neugarten. I am currently completing my PhD at the [Radboud University, Nijmegen](https://www.ru.nl/) in the project [Anchoring Innovation](https://anchoringinnovation.nl/).  My dissertation has the preliminary title _Gods, Heroes, Myths: Anchoring and Innovating Classical Motifs in Fanfiction._

In my free time, I enjoy creative writing, cooking and baking, boardgames and spinning.

## Research Interest

My research centers around the analysis of fanfiction and a variety of other fan practices. I am also interested in the ways that methods from the digital humanities, particularly computational literary studies, can be applied to the study of fanfiction, fandom, and fan communities.
