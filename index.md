## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profielfoto1.jpg">

Hi!

My name is Julia Neugarten. I am currently conducting my PhD research at the [Radboud University, Nijmegen](https://www.ru.nl/) in the project [Anchoring Innovation](https://anchoringinnovation.nl/).  My dissertation has the preliminary title _Gods, Heroes, Myths: Anchoring and Innovating Classical Motifs in Fanfiction._

I am a member of the [Netherlands Research School for Literary Studies](https://www.oslit.nl/julia-neugarten-anchoring-and-innovating-classical-motifs-in-fanfiction/) and an associated member of [OIKOS](https://www.rug.nl/research/research-let/oikos/about/), the Dutch National Research School in Classical Studies. I am also a member of the editorial board of the [Digital Humanities Benelux Journal](https://journal.dhbenelux.org/).

In my free time, I enjoy creative writing, cooking and baking, boardgames and spinning.

## Research Interest

My research centers around the analysis of fanfiction and a variety of other fan practices. I am also interested in the ways that methods from the digital humanities, particularly computational literary studies, can be applied to the study of fanfiction, fandom, and fan communities.
