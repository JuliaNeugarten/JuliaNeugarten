## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profielfoto.jpg">

Hi! I am a junior researcher at the [Huygens Institute](https://www.huygens.knaw.nl/en/) department of [Computational Literary Studies](https://www.huygens.knaw.nl/en/projecten/?thema=computationele-literatuurwetenschap) working on [CLARIAH](https://www.clariah.nl/) and [Impact & Fiction](https://impactandfiction.huygens.knaw.nl/).

In my free time, I enjoy creative writing, cooking and baking, boardgames and spinning.

## Research Interest

My research centers around the way methods from the digital humanities, particularly computational literary studies, can be applied to the study of fanfiction, fandom, and fan communities.
